            Our vision, at e-SHOP, is to be Earth&#39;s most customer centric company; to build 
            a place where people can come to find and discover virtually anything they want 
            to buy online. With e-SHOP.com, we endeavour to build that same destination in 
            India by giving customers more of what they want – low prices, vast selection, 
            fast and reliable delivery, and a trusted and convenient experience – and 
            provide sellers a world-class e-commerce platform. Customers can now shop with 
            confidence from any seller on e-SHOP.com and benefit from a safe and secure 
            online ordering experience, convenient electronic payments and cash on delivery, 
            easy returns, e-SHOP’s customer service with 24x7 support, and a globally 
            recognised and comprehensive purchase protection provided by e-SHOP’s A-to-Z 
            Guarantee. We launched with Books and Movies &amp; TV and have expanded our 
            offerings to include the Kindle family of E-Readers, Tablets and eBooks; Mobiles 
            &amp; Accessories; Cameras &amp; Photography and Portable Media Players. It is still 
            “Day 1” and we will relentlessly focus on expanding selection and raising the 
            bar for customer experience in India. In Feb 2012, e-SHOP Seller Services made 
            its foray into the Indian market with the launch of Junglee.com, enabling 
            retailers in India to advertise their products for free to millions of Indian 
            shoppers and drive targeted traffic to their stores. With the introduction of 
            the e-SHOP.com marketplace and launch of two new programmes – ‘Sell on e-SHOP’ 
            and ‘Fulfilment by e-SHOP&#39; – sellers across India now have access to unlimited 
            and free ‘virtual shelf space’ and a scalable, pay-as-you-go fulfilment and 
            customer service offerings. Both programmes have successfully been used by more 
            than two million sellers globally to sell to over 200 million customers 
            worldwide and boost their sales. We will continue to strive to become a trusted 
            and meaningful sales and logistics channel for retailers of all sizes across 
            India by doing the heavy lifting, enabling them to focus on their core business 
            functions and efficiently grow their business online. e-SHOP.com is operated by
